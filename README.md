### This repo contains the notebooks to train the models mentioned in the paper:
# Using mobile phone images to identify Chagas Disease Vectors with Deep Learning
## A Convolutional Neural Network to recognize Triatoma infestans, a Chagas disease vector, using images from standard mobile phones.

Under each folder identified with Convolutional neural network name (i.e. CNN-A) you will find the notebooks and images used to train the model.
Additionally you will find the output model.

These notebooks have been tested on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

In the [GeoVin](https://github.com/lpattori/GeoVin) repo you will find a sample app to test the models. 

Portions of the code have been copied from [Fastai](https://Fast.ai)
